<h2>Here's some great info about your favorite type of doggy</h2>
<h3>The Samoyed Name Is Often Mispronounced</h3>

<p>Most people assume this handsome dog’s name is pronounced Sa-MOY-ed, but the correct pronunciation is actually SAMmy-ed. The Samoyed also goes by a few other names, including some real tongue-twisters: Bjelkier, Samoiedskaya Sobaka, and Nemetskaya Laika.</p>

<p><em>Nicknames for the breed include “Sammy,” “Sam,” and “Smiley.”</em></p>

<h3>Samoyeds Are Good with Children and Other Dogs</h3>

<p>A well-socialized Sammy loves kids, but it’s important that interactions with small children be supervised to prevent the dog from unintentionally knocking over a little guy or girl.</p>

<p>Samoyeds typically have calm temperaments, so they do well around other dogs – especially if they are raised together from an early age.</p>
